Please provide as much relevant detail into your request as possible.

Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a code contribution you'd like to make, pull requests are encouraged!  All pull requests will reviewed, and feedback will be provided, regardless of if it's accepted, rejected, or changes are requested first.

Please make sure to test any pull requests thoroughly on the latest Development branch changes.

A few requirments for any code contributions:

* Submit all pull requests on the 'development' branch in GitHub
* Test all pull requests as thoroughly as possible
* Note any bugs, outstanding issues, or anything that still needs to be tested (if you were unable to test a part)
* All submit .py files must adhere to PEP8/Flake8 standards.  Currently, all NetConfig .py files adhere to Flake8 standards, with a few exceptions:
    * E501 - line too long (82 > 79 characters)
    * N802 - function name should be lowercase
    * N803 - argument name should be lowercase
    * N806 - variable in function should be lowercase

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any and all documentation submissions are welcome.  If you submit detailed documentation, I will be happy to format it and introduce it properly into the official readthedocs.io documentation.
